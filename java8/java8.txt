an instance of greeting interface
a lambda expression the type of lambda expression is greeting

whats happening here lambda expression is behaving as instance of greeting actually its a function

we are implementing the interface by just implementing the function not class

Type inference:

compiler has the ability to identify the type of lambda expression, return type and argument type.


class TypeInference{
	public static void main(String args[]){
		LenghthOfString lenghthOfString = (String s)->s.length();
	}
	
	interface LenghthOfString{
		int lengthOfString(String s);
	}
}


Runnable using lambdas:

explain thread example with inner class

after replace with lambda expression

Thread t = new Thread ((){
	System.out.println("dsfdsf");
}
});


Thread t = new Thread (()->{
	System.out.println("dsfdsf");
}
);

t.start();
